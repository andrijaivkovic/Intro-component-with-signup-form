## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say _"[Field Name] cannot be empty"_
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say _"Looks like this is not an email"_

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript and Constraint Validation API

### What I learned

By bulding this project I practiced my CSS skills, specifically Flexbox and learned more about Constraint Validation API used<br>
for client side form validation.

### Continued development

In the future I'd like to learn more about CSS Grid.

### Useful resources

On this MDN [Link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Form_validation) you can learn more about Constraint Validation API<br>
that I used in this project to implement client-side form validation.
